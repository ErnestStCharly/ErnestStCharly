- 👋 Hi, I’m @ErnestStCharly
- 👀 I did some years of coding Cobol, PL1 and some other weird languages in the 70ties. Thereafter became a plane driver and now retired.
- 🌱 I’m currently using Mint, Manjaro, Sparky and some other distros (for rescue missions).
- 💞️ I’m searching GITHUB for scripts and help occasionally
